# sanapeli

A word game where the player forms Finnish words from the given letters within a certain time.

Needs the main file "sanapeli.py" (or "sanapeli.exe" if there is no Python interpreter in use) and the list of the valid words "sanalista.txt" (from the research center of native languages of Finland). The word list file "sanalista.txt" has to be in the same folder as the main file.

Written with Python 3.6 using the modules tkinter, random, re, itertools and os (all in the standard library). Used Anaconda environment and Spyder editor.
